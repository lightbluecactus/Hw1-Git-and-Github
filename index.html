	<img src="images/self-profile.png" alt="My profile in The Powerpuff Girls' style" width="360" height="360">
	<p>This is an original character of myself. Since I do not like to post my photos on the internet, I select this Powerpuff Girls'style painting as my image.</p>
	<p>I come from China, an ordinary student who would not like to go to workplace as soon as graduate. I like drawing and painting, and that's why I chose Interactive Media Design, but I never thought I am learning so much about code here! </p>
	<p>Apart from painting, I like to play COC TRPG, and this is a kind of table-top role play game. In this game, I could play as a fictional character, and I find it very interesting to experience different jobs and lives. I always do a lot of research about the job that I want to choose before the start of game. So far I have played as a detactor, a vlogger and even a truck driver! The story of COC TRPG is another interesting point, I enjoy those amazing plots about how the game players dig the truth and interact with NPCs. Now I even want to become a game keeper to introduce this game to others and play with me.</p>
